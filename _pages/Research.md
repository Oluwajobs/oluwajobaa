I am a NASA Earth Science Fellow pursuing an interdisciplinary Ph.D. at Purdue University. My research interests are at the intersection of Statistical Physics, Complex Networks, Urban Meteorology, and Remote Sensing. I have a sustained interest in the complexity, inter-dependency, and dynamism of complex socio-technological urban systems, and am passionate about engineering smart, resilient cities. My doctoral thesis is focused on characterizing *intra-urban complexity* of the Urban Heat Island. Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained degrees in Civil and Architectural Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and Purdue respectively.


## Doctoral Research Themes

| **Urban Heat Islands as an archipelago of Fractal intra-urban heat islets** <br> <br> Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) are traditionally quantified by a bulk metric of SUHI Intensity. However, cities are highly spatially heterogeneous and temperatures within vary widely. Inspired by the [fractal nature of cities](http://www.complexcity.info/), we show for the first time, that for diverse cities across the world, SUHIs are fractal in nature. We analyze the SUHI as a collection of *intra-urban heat islets* and leverage the self-similarity to develop comprehensive metrics to quantify intra-urban thermal complexity. <br> <br> Read more: [[Phys. Rev. E.](10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032142)] [[SPIE Remote Sensing](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2501441)] [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/t9s3g)] [[Poster Summary](/assets/files/Poster_LCLUC_Anamika.pdf)] | <img src="/assets/images/PRE_pic2.png" width="1600px" alt="PRE"> |

| **Paradox of expansion vs densification for reducing extreme urban heat** <br> <br> Given the heterogeneity of urban temperatures for various urban morphologies, what is the optimal spatial pattern to improve thermal comfort? Here, we build upon the multi-scale framework of intra-urban heat islets and investigate the impact of expansion (sprawl) vs densification of cities on the emergence of extreme heat islets. We find that a sprawling configuration is favorable for reducing the mean temperature of a city. However, for the same mean SUHI intensity, it also results in higher local thermal extremes.  <br> <br> Read more: [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/gxj9m/)] [In review with Scientific Reports] | <img src="/assets/images/NSR_pic2.png" width="1800px" alt="NSR"> |

| **Influence of heat waves on intra-urban heat islets** <br> <br> Heat waves are known further exacerbate the urban heat islands. I am currently working in collaboration with NOAA's Center for Earth System Sciences and Remote Sensing Technologies ([NOAA-CESSRST](https://www.noaacrest.org/)) to explore the impact of such heat waves on the dynamics of intra-urban heat islets and the role of complex urban morphology in this interaction. I am using a combination of remotely sensed observations as well as the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model to simulate the heat waves of 2018 experienced by three major megacities - Paris, Los Angeles, and New Delhi <br><br> Catch my presentation at [AGU Fall Meeting 2019](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting) in San Francisco | <img src="/assets/images/Paris.png" width="1800px" alt="Paris"> |

## Master's Research Themes

| **Resilience Analysis of Climate Proofing strategies of cities** <br> <br> Cities are at the forefront of climate change impacts and face a growing burden of adaptation to ensuing natural hazards. In response, the global network of [C-40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/) have adopted various strategies to “climate proof” themselves. Here, we use the Stability Landscape model of a *ball-in-a-bowl*, adapted from [Walker et. al. (2004)](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/inline.html), to investigate the [top 100 strategies](https://issuu.com/sustainia/docs/cities100) of 2015 from an Urban Resilience viewpoint. With this model, we are able to demonstrate the need and possible pathways for adaptation to climate extremes in a more comprehensive way. <br><br> Get in touch for further details: [[View Poster](/assets/files/C40_AMS-Poster.pdf)] [[Presentation](/assets/files/C40_report.pdf)] | <img src="/assets/images/C40-header.png" width="2400px" alt="C40"> |

| **Impact of spatial organization of Local Climate Zones on Urban Surface temperatures** <br> <br> [Local Climate Zones (LCZ)](http://www.wudapt.org/lcz/) are an urban land cover land use classification system that help standardize methods of observation and documentation in urban heat island studies. It is based on a random forest classification workflow implemented in SAGA GIS. I worked on developing LCZ maps for diverse cities across the world. While there is a point-to-point correlation between the LCZ classes and Urban Temperatures, the spatial neighborhoods of each LCZs strongly influence the temperature distributions as well. <br><br> Read more: [[Poster](/assets/files/LCZ_LST_AMS-poster.pdf)] [[BAMS Article](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0236.1)] | <img src="/assets/images/LCZ.png" width="1600px" alt="LCZ"> |
